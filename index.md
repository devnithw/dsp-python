!!! question "About Me"

    I am Devnith Wijesinghe, a second year Biomedical Engineering undergraduate at University of Moratuwa. I am interested in learning about signal processing and deep learning. I write articles and tutorials about what I learn so I created this collection of mini-projects that I have done to share with the world. Feel free to reach me at wijesinghecd.21@uom.lk
